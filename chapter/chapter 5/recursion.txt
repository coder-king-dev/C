important notes of recursion

1. Recursion is often a direct way to implement certain algorithms, but not
always the most direct for every algorithm. Recursion is particularly suited for
problems that can be divided into smaller, similar subproblems (like factorial
computation or tree traversal), but for some algorithms, iterative approaches
might be more straightforward or efficient.


2. The condition in a recursive function that stops further recursion is called
the base case. This correction clarifies that the base case is crucial as it
prevents infinite recursion and ensures the function terminates correctly.


3. Sometimes, due to an oversight by the programmer, a recursive function can
continue to run indefinitely without reaching a base case, potentially
causing a stack overflow or memory error. This statement highlights the risk of
infinite recursion and its consequences, emphasizing the importance of properly
defining base cases in recursive functions.
